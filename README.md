# loan_prediction

This is an open competition project on Analytics Vidhya: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/

In this we are give 2 datasets, train.csv and test.csv

We need to predict if a person will get the loan or not by training the model with train.csv data.

It is a classification probelm as we can divide the result in 'Yes' or 'No' and thus RandomForestClassifier is used.
